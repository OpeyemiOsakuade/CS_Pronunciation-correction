## Inpainting in the Frequency - Universal Speech Super-Resolution with Diffusion Models

Chin-Yun Yu, Sung-Lin Yeh

### Abstract

Current successful audio suepr-resolution models are based
on supervised training, where a paired of input and output is
given as guidance. Despite its strong performance in practice, these methods cannot generalize to data generated outside their training settings, such as a fixed upscaling rate or a
range of input sampling rates. In this work, we leverage the
recent success of diffusion models on solving inverse problems and introduce a new inference algorithm for diffusion
models to do audio super-resolution. Coupling with a single
unconditional audio generation model, our method can generate high quality 48 kHz audio from various input sampling
rates. Evaluation on VCTK multi-speaker benchmark shows
state-of-the-art results.
